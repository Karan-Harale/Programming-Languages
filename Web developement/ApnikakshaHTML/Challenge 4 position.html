        <b>Mykart</b> Private Limited is an Indian e-commerce company,
        headquartered in Bengaluru, and incorporated in Singapore as a private
        limited company. The company initially focused on online book sales
        before expanding into other product categories such as consumer
        electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle
        products. The service competes primarily with Amazon's Indian subsidiary
        and domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a
        39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart has a
        dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition
        of Myntra, and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the
        sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a
        mobile payments service based on the UPI. In August 2018, American
        retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for
        US$16 billion, valuing Flipkart at around US$20 billion.[9] Flipkart is
        valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022.[10] It is planning to go public
        through a listing in the United States of America in 2023. Contents 1

        Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the IIT, Delhi and former Amazon
        employees.[11][12][13] The company initially focused on online book
        sales with country-wide shipping. Flipkart slowly grew in prominence and
        was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[14] In 2010, Flipkart acquired
        the Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from
        Lulu.com.[15] In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution
        business Mime360.com[16] and the digital content library of the
        Bollywood portal Chakpak.[17] Following the acquisition, Flipkart
        launched their DRM-free online music store Flyte in 2012. Due to
        competition from free streaming sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut
        down in June 2013.[18][19][20][21] With its eyes on India's retail
        market, Flipkart acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[22]
        in 2012, and Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in
        May 2014.[23] Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a
        standalone subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[24] In
        February 2014, Flipkart partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the
        exclusive Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone.[25] Motorola also
        partnered with Flipkart on the Moto E, a phone targeted primarily
        towards emerging markets such as India. High demand for the phone
        following its midnight launch on 14 May caused the Flipkart website to
        crash.[26] Flipkart subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for
        other smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi 3 in July 2014 (whose initial
        release of 10,000 devices sold out in around 5 seconds),[27] and the
        Redmi 1S and Redmi Note in late 2014.[28][29][30][31] On 6 October 2014,
        coinciding with the company's anniversary and the Diwali season,[32]
        Flipkart held a major sale that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The
        event generated a surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of
        goods in 10 hours. The event received criticism via social media over
        technical issues experienced during the event and stock
        shortages.[33][34][35][36] In April 2015, Flipkart acquired Appiterate,
        a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation firm. Flipkart stated that it
        would use Appiterate's technology to enhance its mobile services.[37] In
        December 2015, Flipkart purchased a minority stake in the digital
        mapping provider MapmyIndia.[38] In October 2015, Flipkart reprised the
        Big Billion Days event as a multi-day event exclusive to the Flipkart
        app. Flipkart bolstered its supply chain and introduced more fulfillment
        centers to meet customer demand.[39] Flipkart achieved a gross
        merchandise volume of US$300 million during the event, with the largest
        volumes coming from fashion sales and the largest value coming from
        mobiles.[40] In 2016, Flipkart acquired the online fashion retailer
        Jabong.com from Rocket Internet for US$70 million and the UPI mobile
        payments startup PhonePe.[41][42] In January 2017, Flipkart made a US$2
        million investment in TinyStep, a parenting information startup.[43] In
        April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary,
        eBay.in, to Flipkart and invest US$500 million in the company. While
        eBay suggested that the partnership would allow Flipkart to access
        eBay's network of international vendors, these plans never came to
        fruition.[44][45] In July 2017, Flipkart made an offer to acquire its
        main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for US$700 to 800 million. It was
        rejected by Snapdeal, which was seeking at least US$1 billion.[46] In
        2017, Flipkart sold 1.3 million phones in 20 hours on 21 September
        during its Big Billion Days promotion, doubling the number sold on the
        first day of the same event in 2016.[47] Flipkart held a 51% share of
        all Indian smartphone shipments in 2017, overtaking Amazon India
        (33%).[48] On 4 May 2018, it was reported that Walmart had won a bidding
        war with Amazon to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart for US$15
        billion.[49][50] On 9 May 2018, Walmart officially announced its intent
        to acquire a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion.[51]
        Following the purchase, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal left the
        company. The remaining management team reported to Marc Lore, CEO of
        Walmart eCommerce US.[52] Walmart president Doug McMillon cited plans to
        help Flipkart with its sourcing and supply chain, while tapping on its
        expertise to expand Walmart globally.[53] Indian traders protested
        against the deal, considering it a threat to domestic business.[54][55]
        In a filing with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 11 May
        2018, Walmart stated that a condition of the deal prescribed the
        possibility that Flipkart's current minority shareholders "may require
        Flipkart to effect an initial public offering following the fourth
        anniversary of the closing of the transactions at a valuation no less
        than that paid by Walmart".[56][57] Following the announcement of
        Walmart's deal, eBay announced that it would sell its stake in Flipkart
        back to the company for approximately US$1.1 billion and relaunch its
        own Indian operations. The company stated that "there is the huge growth
        potential for e-commerce in India and significant opportunity for
        multiple players to succeed in India's diverse, domestic market."[44]
        Softbank Group also sold its entire 20% stake to Walmart without
        disclosing terms of the sale.[58] Walmart's acquisition of 77% stake in
        Flipkart was completed on 18 August 2018. Walmart also provided US$2
        billion in equity funding to the company.[59][60] On 13 November 2018,
        Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal resigned after facing an allegation of
        "serious personal misconduct". Walmart stated that "while the
        investigation did not find evidence to corroborate the complainant's
        assertions against Binny, it did reveal other lapses in judgment,
        particularly a lack of transparency, related to how Binny responded to
        the situation."[61][62] In August 2019, Flipkart partnered with
        Authentic Brands to license and distribute Nautica in India.[63] It was
        reported the same month that Flipkart entered talks to invest around
        US$40 million in last-mile delivery startup Shadowfax, which would be
        the company's third investment in the logistics sector after backing
        BlackBuck and QikPod.[64] The deal was completed four months later as a
        US$60 million financing round.[65] It also launched a reward system
        called Super coins which allowed customers to earn points on various
        Flipkart brands like Myntra, Cleartrip and Phonepe.[66] Flipkart
        invested US$4 million in the customer engagement and rewards platform
        EasyRewardz on 19 November 2019.[67][68] In 2020, Flipkart Wholesale
        launched a digital platform for kiranas and MSMEs.[69] In July 2020,
        Flipkart acquired a 27% stake in Arvind Fashions Limited's newly formed
        subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands for US$35 million. Arvind Youth Brands
        owns the Flying Machine brand.[70] Flipkart also announced it will roll
        out Flipkart Quick, a hyperlocal 90-minute delivery service for product
        categories such as groceries, home accessories, mobile phones,
        stationery, and more.[71] In October 2020, Flipkart acquired a 7.8%
        stake in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail for US$204 million.[72][73] The
        following month, Flipkart acquired the intellectual property of gaming
        startup Mech Mocha for an undisclosed amount.[74] The acquisition formed
        part of Flipkart's plans to gain and retain users by offering casual
        games.[75] In November 2020, Flipkart acquired augmented reality company
        Scapic, which provides a suite of tools to create and publish augmented
        reality, virtual reality, and 3D content quickly and without coding.[76]
        In April 2021, Flipkart announced the acquisition of travel booking
        portal Cleartrip.[77]
